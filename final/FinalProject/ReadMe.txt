This program is intended to work as a boardgame Companion, not replacement.

This program will help you setup the card game.

Even tho the program keeps scores, always remember to update anything you need to update on you table.

The game plays out, first picking a scenario, then a hero or a group of heroes.

Each round consists of Hero turn and Villain turn.

The game ends when:
-Villain dies.
-All Heroes die.
-Main scheme is completed.

This program tracks HP, and Main scheme, and ends if any is completed.

It also let's you save your game with every current stat.

This code, program, can be used in the future to actually simulate a full game.
